# Role-Based-Toolbar-Customization-in-Syncfusion-Document-Editor-for-Legal-Workflows
This repository demonstrates how to implement role-based toolbar customization in the Syncfusion Document Editor (a.k.a. Word Processor) within a React application. It showcases a legal workflow use case where different user roles—such as lawyers, reviewers, and administrators—see tailored toolbar options to enhance both usability and document security.
